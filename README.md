# Exercise to connect and use Auth0 + React

This project follows the React.js User Login and Registration with Auth0 tutorial by Dave Gray

In it, I learned to connect an Auth0 application to my GitHub profile, and how to apply a simple login system to a React app.

Note, you will need an Auth0 account for this project. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Once the Dev server has started, you will see a simple sign-in button.

When you click sign-in button you will be redirected to a page that will let you sign in using GitHub, or your email for your Auth0 account. 

Once signed in, you will see available information such as your username, github profile pic (if you have one) and more.  

Enjoy!
